# CS303-Assignment3-Caden-Cunningham
Contains my Assignment 3 code with 3 files - main.cpp, Functions.cpp. and Queue.h

Requires download of main.cpp, Functions.cpp, and Queue.h.

QUEUE: My main code contains class functions built from my template Queue class. My queue is implemented using a single linked list. When running main, a queue is initialized and the values 1-10 are pushed onto the queue. After initialization, the code in main runs to display the working queue functions with output to the terminal.

// Queue Functions
push() - Pushes a node to end of the queue
pop() - Deletes the node at the start
front() - Returns the data from the start node
size() - Returns the size of the queue
empty() - Returns true if the queue is empty
display() - Iterates through the queue and outputs node's data to the terminal
move_to_rear() - Move's the start value to the end of the queue 
insertion_sort() - Uses the insertion sort to sort values in the queue

// Queue Output
